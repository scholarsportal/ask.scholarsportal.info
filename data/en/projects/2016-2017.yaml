description: '2016-2017, Ask a Librarian’s sixth year of service, was a period of transition. We changed chat software providers and migrated to a new platform, [LibraryH3lp](https://libraryh3lp.com/), to better meet the needs of our busy consortial service. Throughout these changes, we maintained a high level of service quality, as indicated by users’ positive exit survey responses (see image above). For a complete summary of the service year, including chat volume statistics and user satisfaction rates, [download our “year in review” report](docs/Stats_16-17_en.pdf).'
