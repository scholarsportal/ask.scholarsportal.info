description: '2014-2015 was an important year of growth for the Ask a Librarian service. We launched a French-language partner service, called Clavardez avec nos bibliothécaires, which allowed us to welcome several libraries with bilingual service mandates to Ask a Librarian. Consequently, we experienced an 11% increase in chat volume during the year (see image above).
